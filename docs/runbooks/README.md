# Runbooks

One runbook per alert or known failure mode, written when the failure mode is introduced.

## Template

```markdown
# <Title of the failure>

- **Symptom:** what the alert or the operator sees
- **Impact:** what is broken for whom
- **Diagnosis:** commands to run, what to look for
- **Mitigation:** steps to restore service
- **Escalation / rollback:** what to do if mitigation fails
- **Links:** ADRs, research notes, dashboards
```

## Index

_(empty — first runbooks arrive in P1/P2, e.g. host power loss and Galera recovery)_
